#+END_EXPORT


* Overview
One of the more onerous tasks when writing a ~gem~ or other ~github~ project
is maintaining the documentation, and keeping it consistent and up-to-date.
One of the better options for writing the ~README~ file that gets displayed by
~github~ as the main documentation is to write the file in ~org-mode~,
~README.org~ the export it to markdown ~README.md~ for display by ~github~.

Doing so gives you access to ~org-mode~'s code blocks for writing example code
to demonstrate the ~gem~ or other documents being presented.  If you do so,
~github~ will render your ~README.org~ file in ~HTML~ and give you a credible
result.  However, ~github~ cannot handle some ~org-mode~ features, and in
particular, it will not render ~#+RESULTS~ blocks showing the results of code
block execution unless you wrap the results in something like a
~#+begin_example~ block and manually delete the ~#+RESULTS~ markers.
Exporting to markdown eliminates that hassle.

This gem contains ~rake~ tasks to facilitate the production of documentation
in other gems.

It provides tasks for:

- ensuring that proper code block setup is included in ~README.org~ to
  facilitate running ~ruby~ code blocks in a session using the current version
  of the library,
- running the code block examples in a ~README.org~ by invoking ~emacsclient~,
- exporting ~README.org~ to Git-flavored markdown in ~README.md~
- ensuring a workflow or ci badge is present in the ~README.md~
- generating yard documents for your repo, and
- copying the introductory contents of the README as a leading comment in your
  main gem library file so it gets picked up as an overview for ~ri~ and ~yri~


* Installation
** Install the ox-gfm Emacs package
The export of ~README.org~ to ~README.md~ requires the ~ox-gfm~ package to be
installed in Emacs.  If you use ~use-package~, this will suffice:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
  (use-package ox-gfm)
#+end_src

** Install the gem
Install the gem and add to the application's ~Gemfile~ by executing:

#+begin_src sh :eval no
  bundle add gem_docs
#+end_src

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:
#+begin_src sh :eval no
  gem install gem_docs
#+end_src

** Update Your ~Rakefile~
To use this gem place the following lines in your gem's ~Rakefile~:
#+begin_src ruby :eval no
  require "gem_docs"
  GemDocs.install
#+end_src

* Usage
** Create a skeleton README.org file
This is a simple task that creates a bare-bones ~README.org~ file to get
started with.  It does create the file with the name of the gem and other repo
detains filled in.  If there is already a README.org file, it does nothing.

#+begin_src ruby :eval no
 rake docs:skeleton
#+end_src

** Add proper ~#+PROPERTY~ headers in ~README.org~: ~rake docs:headers~
Getting emacs code blocks to render well in your ~README.org~ takes proper
configuration of the code block headers in Emacs.

#+begin_src ruby :eval no
 rake docs:headers
#+end_src

By default, the ~gem_docs~ ~rake docs:headers~ task will add the following
headers to the top of your ~README.org~ file.  It does nothing if any ruby
header args are already present, so remove them if you want these installed.

#+begin_example
#+PROPERTY: header-args:ruby :results value :colnames no :hlines yes :exports both :dir "./"
#+PROPERTY: header-args:ruby+ :wrap example :session gem_docs_session
#+PROPERTY: header-args:ruby+ :prologue "$:.unshift('./lib') unless $:.first == './lib'; require '%n'"
#+PROPERTY: header-args:sh :exports code :eval no
#+PROPERTY: header-args:bash :exports code :eval no
#+end_example

Here's what the ruby headers buy you:
- ~:results value~ :: the value of the last expression in the block is rendered
  as the results of code execution.  If you want the output instead for a
  particular block, just add the block argument ~:results output~ to the code
  block.
- ~:colnames no~ :: prevents org from processing the column headers in tables
  it renders.  It is better for you to control column headers, and this
  setting allows this.
- ~:hlines yes~ :: prevents org from stripping hlines from tables, which also
  allows you to control the insertion of hlines in tables.
- ~:exports both~ :: causes both your code and the results of evaluation to be
  exported to the ~README.md~.  Your example blocks should demonstrate the use
  of the gem, and the reader will want to see both the code and its results.
- ~:dir "./"~ :: causes each code block to execute with your gem's root
  directory as its current directory.
- ~:wrap example~ :: this wraps the result of code block evaluation in
  ~#+begin_example~ / ~#+end_example~ so that the results are displayed
  literally.
- ~:session gem_docs_session~ :: causes the code blocks to execute in a
  continuous session, so that variables set up in one code block are
  accessible in later code blocks.  Without this, you would have to build the
  code environment anew with each code block which obscures the readability of
  your ~README~.  The session name is set to '<gem_name>_session'
  automatically, where <gem_name> is the name of your gem.
- ~:prologue "$:.unshift('./lib') unless $:.first == './lib'; require 'gem_name'"~
  :: this prologue gets executed before each code block execution and ensures
  that the version of the gem library is you current development version;
  otherwise, your code blocks could be running a version from a prior
  installation of the gem.  The 'gem_name' in the require is set to the name
  of your gem automatically.

The ~docs:headers~ task also turns off evaluation of shell code blocks since
these will often be such things as demonstrating the shell commands to install
the gem, etc.  Of course, you can override this for particular code blocks.

Those headers are in fact what I am using in this ~README~, and here is how
they work.

*** Output Tables
You can build table for ~org~ to display in the output by returning an array
of arrays, which org-mode renders as a table in the output.  You can add an
hline to the output table by simply adding ~nil~ to the outer array where you
want the hline to occur.

#+begin_src ruby
  result = []
  result << ['N', 'exp(N)']
  result << nil
  0.upto(10) do |n|
    result << [n/3.0, Math.exp(n/3.0)]
  end
  result
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
|                  N |             exp(N) |
|--------------------+--------------------|
|                0.0 |                1.0 |
| 0.3333333333333333 | 1.3956124250860895 |

| 3.3333333333333335 |  28.03162489452614 |
#+end_example

*** Output Values
Sometimes, however, you just want the result of the code block evaluated
without building a table.  To do so, just set the block header to ~:results
value raw~.

To compute the value of an $1,000 asset gaining 5% continuously compounding
interest over four years, you might do this:

#+begin_src ruby :results value raw
  rate = 0.05
  time = 4
  principal = 1000
  principal * Math.exp(rate * time)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
1221.40275816017
#+end_example

Apart from all the convenient markup that ~org-mode~ allows, the ability to
easily demonstrate your gem's code in this way is the real killer feature of
writing your ~README~ in ~org-mode~ then exporting to markdown.

** Run the Code Blocks in README.org: ~rake docs:tangle~
You can invoke ~emacsclient~ to run all the example code blocks in your
~README.org~ that are set for evaluation:

Note that the ~tangle~ task relies on ~emacsclient~ to evaluate the code blocks in
~README.org~, so your Emacs ~init~ files should start [[info:emacs#Emacs Server][the Emacs server]] in
order to work properly.

I use the following snippet in my Emacs init file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
  (require 'server)
  (unless (server-running-p)
    (message "Starting Emacs server")
    (server-start))
#+end_src

Then, you can evaluate all the code blocks in your ~README.org~ like this:

#+begin_src ruby :eval no
 rake docs:tangle
#+end_src

With the default headers provided by `rake docs:headers`, the buffer is
evaluated in a session so that code blocks can build on one another.  However,
`docs:tangle` kills any existing session buffer before it runs so that each
buffer evaluation is independent of earlier runs.

** Ensure that a Badge is Present in ~README.md~: ~rake docs:badge~
It is reassuring to consumers of your gem that your gem passes its workflow
tests on github.  This task checks to see if a "badge" indicating success or
failure is present and, if not, inserts one at the top of the ~README.org~
such that it will get exported to ~README.md~ when =rake docs:export= is run.

If you want to place the badge somewhere else in you ~README.org~, place the
special comment ~#badge~ where you want the badge located and the task will
place it there.

If there is already a badge present, the task will not modify the ~README.org~
file.

** Export ~README.org~ to ~README.md~: ~rake docs:export~
You can write the ~README~ in Emacs org-mode, using all its features
including the execution of code blocks, and then export to git-flavored
markdown.

If your repo contains both ~README.org~ and ~README.md~, github (and gitlab)
will render the markdown version.

Github renders markdown better than it renders org files, so this helps with
the readability of the ~README~ on github.  For example, if you write the
~README~ in org mode without exporting to markdown, ~github~ will not render
the ~#+RESULTS~ blocks unless you manually delete the ~#+RESULTS~ tag from the
output.  This is tedious and error-prone, so it is best that you write the
~README~ in ~org-mode~ and export to ~markdown~.  That's what this task
enables.

Also note that when ~github~ renders your ~README.md~, it automatically adds a
table of contents, so putting one in the ~README.org~ file is redundant.  If
you want to have one for your own purposes, just set the ~:noexport~ tag on it
so it doesn't get put into the ~README.md~

#+begin_src ruby :eval no
  rake docs:export
#+end_src

** Generate Yard Documents: ~rake docs:yard~
This task generates a suitable ~.yardopts~ file if none exists and then
generates ~yard~ documents into the gem's ~doc~ directory.  It also makes sure
that ~yard~ knows about your ~README.md~ file so user's of your gem will be
able to get an overview of how to use your gem.

#+begin_src ruby :eval no
  rake docs:yard
#+end_src

** Generate an Overview Comment for the Main gem File: ~rake docs:overview~
Gem's typically gather into a central library file all the require's and other
setup needed for the gem and the file is given the same name as the gem.  For
example, this gem uses the file =lib/gem_docs.rb= for this purpose.  Since
this =lib= directory is placed in the user's =LOADPATH=, a =require
'gem_docs'= or =require '<gemname>'= effectively initializes the gem.

By convention the comment immediately above the 'module' definition in your
main library file is used by =yard= and =ri= as the overview for the gem.

#+begin_src ruby :eval no
  rake docs:overview
#+end_src

This extracts the "Introduction" section from ~README.org~ and makes it the
overview comment in the gem's main library file.  If it already exists, it
replaces it with any newer version of the "Introduction" section, otherwise,
it does not change the file.

* Configuration
The tasks defined by ~gem_docs~ should work out of the box with no
configuration.  They determine things like the name of the gem, your github
user name, etc., by examining files in your repo.  If this process gets things
wrong, it should be considered a possible bug and reported.

Still, you can configure ~gem_docs~ with a configure block in your ~Rakefile~.
In this gem, for example, my ~Rakefile~ contains this:

#+begin_src ruby :eval no
  require "gem_docs"
  GemDocs.install
  GemDocs.configure do |c|
    c.overview_headings = ["Overview", "Usage"]
  end
#+end_src

It tells the ~docs:overview~ task to use the "Overview" and "Usage" sections
of this ~README.org~ as the overview comment.  This is the most common reason
you may want to add a configure block.

The following are the items that can be configured:
#+begin_src ruby
  GemDocs.configure do |c|
    c.overview_headings = ["Introduction"]
    c.headers =
      <<~HEADER
        ,#+PROPERTY: header-args:ruby :results value :colnames no :hlines yes :exports both :dir "./"
        ,#+PROPERTY: header-args:ruby+ :wrap example :session %n_session :eval yes

        ,#+PROPERTY: header-args:sh :exports code :eval no
        ,#+PROPERTY: header-args:bash :exports code :eval no
      HEADER
    c.repo_host = nil
    c.repo_name = nil
    c.repo_user = nil
    c.repo_branch = nil
    c.repo_workflow_dir = ".github/workflows"
    c.repo_workflow_name = nil
    c.badge =
      <<~BADGE
        ,#+BEGIN_EXPORT markdown
          [![CI](https://github.com/%u/%n/actions/workflows/%w/badge.svg?branch=%b)](https://github.com/%u/%n/actions/workflows/%w)
        ,#+END_EXPORT
      BADGE
  end
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
,#+BEGIN_EXPORT markdown

#+end_example

The items that are set to ~nil~ here are populated at runtime by examining
files in the gem's directory.  In the strings for ~headers~ and ~badge~,
several markers are available as standins for these runtime values:

- %h :: the repo host, i.e., 'github.com', 'gitlab.com', etc.
- %u :: the repo's username on the host, such as 'ddoherty03' for me,
- %n :: the name of the gem, i.e., 'gem_docs' for this gem,
- %b :: the branch of the repo, by default 'master',
- %r :: the directory where the repo root is located,
- %w :: the name of the workflow to be used in the badge, for example.

* Development
After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then,
run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an
interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake
