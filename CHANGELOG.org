* COMMENT CHANGELOG tips:
1. Don't dump your git change logs into this file, write them yourself.
2. Keep entries short and user-focused,
3. Use non-technical language, but do speak in the vocabulary of your gem.
4. Don't document changes only of interest to the programmers, just those the
   user would find useful.
5. Give each heading an inactove date (C-c ! is useful here) and a version
   number.

* Version 0.3.1 [2025-12-27 Sat]
- Added ruby header to run `bundle exec irb` as the code block process.  This
  should eliminate library mis-matches in running blocks.
- Added export of CHANGELOG.org to CHANGELOG.md;
- Added CHANGELOG skeleton along with README; tasks are now
  `rake docs:skeleton:readme` and `rake docs:skeleton:changelog`.
- Added this CHANGELOG so I have an example to use in my specs.  Oh, and for
  users also.
* Version 0.2.0 [2025-12-23 Tue]
- Make tangle of README.org unconditional, even is it is not newer than
  README.md.  The code examples depend on more than just the text of
  README.org, they especially depend on changes to the gem's lib code, so
  running unconditionally is usually what is wanted.
- Before docs:tangle, kill the session buffer for ruby code blocks so each run
  is independent of prior runs and the current version of the gem lib gets
  loaded.
* Version 0.1.2 [2025-12-23 Fri]
- Initial release
